g-bin
=====

Those files represents my personal BASH and SHELL scripts to perform the most common operations.

You will find all of them on ServerFault (https://www.serverfault.com), but to not waste time, I grouped here.

- g-free-mem, it is a script to clean the memory, expecially using the JVM applications
- g-image, tools to resize and adust images.

Enjoy !
